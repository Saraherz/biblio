	abstract = {The Water Framework Directive in Europe requires extending metering and water abstraction controls to accurately satisfy the necessary water resource requirements. However, in situ measurement instruments are inappropriate for large irrigation surface areas, considering the high investment and maintenance service costs. In this study, Remote Sensing-based Irrigation Water Accounting (RS-IWA) (previously evaluated for commercial plots, water user associations, and groundwater water management scales) was applied to over 11 Spanish river basin districts during the period of 2014–2018. Using the FAO56 methodology and incorporating remote sensing basal crop coefficient time series to simulate the Remote Sensing-based Soil Water Balance (RS-SWB), we were able to provide spatially and temporally distributed net irrigation requirements. The results were evaluated against the irrigation water demands estimated by the Hydrological Planning Offices and published in the River Basin Management Plans applying the same spatial (Agricultural Demand Units and Exploitation Systems) and temporal (annual and monthly) water management scales used by these public water managers, ultimately returning ranges of agreement (r2 and dr) (Willmott refined index) of 0.79 and 0.99, respectively. Thus, this paper presents an operational tool for providing updated spatio-temporal maps of RS-IWA over large and diverse irrigation surface areas, which is ready to serve as a complementary irrigation water monitoring and management tool. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Erratic rainfall with varying intensity and duration has raised the risks of crop failure in semi-arid areas of south and south-east Asia. In subsistence irrigation cropping systems often it's difficult to schedule the irrigation, i.e. when and how much water to irrigate. Therefore there is a need for a regional real/near real-time updated database on vegetation greening and browning to facilitate the irrigation scheduling decisions. With the advent of open archives of remote sensing from United States Geological Survey (USGS) and European Space Agency (ESA) have proven a unique set of long-term historical and near real-time observations. In this study, an attempt has been made to understand the vegetation greening and browning patterns using time series of remote sensing observations for irrigation water management. The main objective is to study the greening and browning of natural vegetation (i.e., grasslands and forests) and agricultural areas of Indian sub-continent for understanding the breaks in the rainfall spells and integrated approach for irrigation scheduling. The time series of vegetation indices have been extracted for predefined grid locations from Sentinel 2 remote sensing sensor. Further, an algorithm based on time series analysis were evaluated for estimating the vegetation growth stages. The estimated vegetation growth stages was compared with the agro-climatic zones. A methodology for subsistence irrigation scheduling has been proposed based on regional vegetation growth stages (i.e. onset, peak and end of the season). The estimated vegetation growth stages showed poor alignment with the agro-climatic zones. The integrated approach based on vegetation growth stages is promising for scheduling subsistence irrigation. The proposed methodology for vegetation growth stage identification has potential applications in drought risk assessment and in establishing key indicators for agro-climatic zones. © 2019 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Water use control methods and water resources planning are of high priority. In irrigated agriculture, the right way to save water is to increase water use efficiency through better management. The present work validates procedures and methodologies using remote sensing to determine the water availability in the soil at each moment, giving the opportunity for the application of the water depth strictly necessary to optimise crop growth (optimum irrigation timing and irrigation amount). The analysis is applied to the Irrigation District of Divor, Évora, using 7 experimental plots, which are areas irrigated by centre-pivot systems, cultivated to maize. Data were determined from images of the cultivated surface obtained by satellite and integrated with atmosphere and crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress in the vegetation—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kc, and Kcb. Therefore, evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated and used to calculate crop water requirement, together with the opportunity and the amount of irrigation water to allocate. Although remote sensing data available from satellite imagery presented some practical constraints, the study could contribute to the validation of a new methodology that can be used for irrigation management of a large irrigated area, easier and at lower costs than the traditional FAO recommended crop coefficients method. The remote sensing based methodology can also contribute to significant saves of irrigation water. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques are used to estimate the Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) in the Regueb-watershed for the summer season, when the peak of the water consumption is reached. The landsat 8 images were used to identify irrigated area and to estimate the IWR in dry season. Five methods were applied for the identification of irrigated area based on supervised classification and spectral indices. Two different approaches were applied to estimate IWR: Kc-NDVI method based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc) and FAO approach based on the empirical equation of Penman–Monteith and the single Kc given by FAO-56. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) performed the highest overall accuracy (85 %) and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. The IWR resulting values range from 10 to 14.5 Mm3 in summer season. To evaluate the methodology, five test areas were selected based on the diversity of crops in the whole study area. The validation of results indicates that the IWR values calculated using FAO method were in good agreement with the IWR values derived from remote sensing approach. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The objectives of management of irrigation systems, although they vary widely, may be defined as high crop productivity per unit land per unit applied water with equity in distribution. Some of the key elements of irrigation system management are: (i) performance monitoring and evaluation, (ii) diagnostic appraisal, (iii) action research, and (iv) farmers' participation. The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art on applications of satellite remote sensing that support management of irrigation systems and to identify emerging approaches that focus on future directions of research which may pave the way to operationalise the remote sensing techniques in practice. Firstly, a brief review on different approaches being utilized for management of irrigation systems is dealt with. Subsequently, the present status of remote sensing applications in irrigated agriculture is reviewed. The paper also presents future perspectives of remote sensing applications in determining hydrological variables and quantifying irrigation system performance indicators for better management of water use in irrigated agriculture.

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture requires the implementation of innovative tools to improve irrigation water management and accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) such as remote sensing-based methodology. This study aimed to evaluate the irrigation management and estimating evapotranspiration through the geeSEBAL, a new tool for automated estimation of ETa based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and a simplified version of the Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme Conditions (CIMEC) process for the endmembers selection, implemented into the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. GeeSEBAL has not been used yet in Brazil for irrigation proposes, and in this research, it was applied to estimate ETa using Landsat images and ERA5-Land as meteorological inputs in the largest sugarcane producing region of the world in Brazil for two ratoon seasons by comparing daily ETa with values obtained from eddy covariance (EC) data, Energy balance components using geeSEBAL were consistent with the measured data and daily ETa presenting RMSE of 0.46 mm with R2 = 0.97. Modeled ETa and Kc were similar for the two seasons, although somewhat overestimated for the fifth ratoon when compared to the EC data, mainly during high atmospheric demand (crop mid-stage). Still, the Kc values were similar to the standard values available in the literature and measured flux tower data for the two ratoons seasons. With ETa from geeSEBAL it was possible to identify water stress over the growing seasons using the remote sensing-based soil water balance, which occurred mainly during the phase after the crop reached the peak Kc (full cover stage) when the irrigation depth required was very high. This analysis showed that geeSEBAL has a significant potential for assessment of ETa for irrigation monitoring and management, even in missing climate data areas, allowing important advances in water resources management for sugarcane and other irrigated crops at field or regional scales. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme’s performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop’s evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {High-efficient usage of irrigation water resources is essential to ensure agricultural production and sustainable utilization of water resources. Climate warming and rapid socio-economic development pose great challenges to the sustainable use of irrigation water resources. Current agricultural production tends to be more intensive, standardized and informationized, resulting in higher requirements for the development of efficient water-saving irrigation and the realization of precision management of irrigation water use. Evapotranspiration can reflect the exchanges of water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere and water consumption by crops, thus playing a key role in irrigation water management. Over the past two decades, with the development of Earth observation technologies, theories and methods of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion are becoming mature, resulting in continuously improving spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of evapotranspiration estimates. This trend has greatly maximized the application potential of remotely based evapotranspiration in the field of irrigation water resources. First, this review summarizes the advances of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion and related widely used datasets. Applications of evapotranspiration in irrigation water use monitoring, irrigation schedule optimization, and evaluation of irrigation benefits are systematically summarized. This review could provide reference for efficient utilization and precise management of agricultural water resources. © 2023 China Water Power Press. All rights reserved.},
